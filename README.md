## Project Information 

### Objective

The term project will allow you to directly apply one or more advanced methods to address a multi-project management problem in a practical setting, as introduced below. The project's objective is for you to leverage the theoretical aspects of project management learned in class and beyond, place project management in a realistic context of an infrastructure operations and maintenance organization, and gain project management experiences from collaborating with your peers.

### Problem Statement

Limited project execution resources available (mainly specialist crews and major equipment) pose significant challenges for planning and scheduling infrastructure operations and maintenance projects. These resources are shared to serve multiple projects, making it challenging to allocate available crews to specific projects subject to resource availability limits as well as contractually obligated constraints such as projects' deadlines and delay penalties. Operation and maintenance of the municipal sewer and water mainline infrastructure is critical for providing essential services to the public. The project management team is tasked with scheduling projects to ensure timely project deliveries and achieve high levels of resource utilization efficiency and client satisfaction.

In operating an extensive network of water and sewer lines, three categories of projects are defined as follows.

1. Client-demanded Projects: this category comprises new water and sewer line installations or repairs demanded by clients. Houses, hospitals, institutional, commercial, and industrial premises are connected to a city water/sewer system (mainlines and branch lines).

2. Prioritized Projects: the maintenance department inspects and monitors the infrastructure network to identify defects and dysfunctions and plan many projects with various priorities. If residents encounter any issues with their area's sewer or water mainline, such as leaks, blockages, or damage, they promptly report to the City through the official website or a dedicated hotline. Formally assessed risk levels as well as regulatory deadlines are considered in setting the priority index of a project. For instance, those projects that pose lower risks to disrupt the public are scheduled to a later time window.

3. Emergency Projects: Emergencies can be collapsed or broken pipes, sewer backups, lost services, and unexpected floods. Emergency projects call for an immediate response; the project team is required to respond promptly (i.e., within 2 hours), aiming to minimize disruptions to residents and businesses by completing the work within 72 hours.

Full-time professional construction crews are each equipped with the required machinery and tools such as Backhoes and trucks. Your team is assigned for project planning, including scheduling and allocating the crews to deliver the projects.
